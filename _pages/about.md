Hi, my name is Alexander Ilyin. I'm currently working as a Data Analyst at the Connor Group in Santa Clara, CA. Before starting at the Connor Group, I completed my MS in Analytics at UC San Diego and my BS in Information Systems at UC Santa Cruz.    




As a Data Analyst, I leverage my problem solving ability and communication skills to provide valuable insights that drive growth. At the Connor Group, I work closely with our clients to assist them in building data pipelines to create an efficient flow of data between their affiliated payment service providers and their internal accounting software and data stores. 




In my free time, I enjoy various outdoors activities such as running, hiking and other sports such as boxing and tennis. I like to keep myself up to speed with the frequent changes in the world of analytics, both by reading journals and blogs, and also by working on unique projects to help expand my skillset. I am a firm believer in the saying "You never stop learning".
